A wider representative sample of human faces would make for a more representative generative model -- not just in terms of race, but also in terms of age and other characteristics, such as facial expressions. A wider datbase of \"faces in the wild\" may produce a more representative sample.\n",

This resulted in better quality generations sooner. More data will give the model more diversity here as well.\n",

That loss may be used for the purpose of early stopping if the images degrade for a reasonable level of patience, or to save the weights for the generator whenever the loss is minimum."
